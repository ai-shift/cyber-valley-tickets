## Problem

Cyber Valley wants to host events and needs a convenient way to accept events offers from creators, sell tickets in crypto, verify bought tickets from customer's devices and distribution of acquired means across creator, master and dev team

## Solution

Create Web3 mobile first web app based on Ethereum network which covers main needs

### Domain

#### Roles

##### Customer

Public role which has the following authorities:

- List events
- Buy ticket to event

##### Staff

Assigned by the master role. Has all customer's authorities and:

- Verify tickets for any event

##### Creator

A.k.a shaman has all customer's authorities and:

- Send event request
- Edit own event requests
- See pending own event requests

##### Master

Has all customer's, staff's and creator's authorities and:

- Create event place
- Approve event requests
- Edit event requests
- Cancel event
- Close events

#### Event data

Abstraction over some entertainment in the specific place during some amount of days.

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class EventModel {
        +int id
        +string title
        +string description
        +string imageUrl
        +EventPlaceModel place
        +int ticketPrice
        +int ticketsBought
        +int cancelDate
        +int startDate
        +int durationDays
    }
```

### Use cases

#### Create event place

**Accessible only by master**

Adds a new event place

**Emits** `EventPlaceUpdated`

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class EventPlace {
        +string title
        +int minTickets
        +int maxTickets
        +int minPrice
        +int minDays
    }
```

#### Update event place

**Accessible only by master**

Updates existing event place by it's id

> **Warning:** Event place can't be changed if there is another event

**Emits** `EventPlaceUpdated`

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    actor Master
    participant TicketsApp
    participant SmartContract

    Master->>TicketsApp: Updated event place data
    TicketsApp->>SmartContract: updateEventPlace(eventPlaceId, maxTickets, minTickets, minPrice, minDays)
    activate SmartContract
    SmartContract->>SmartContract: _validateEventPlace(place)
    SmartContract-->>TicketsApp: Emits EventPlaceUpdated
    deactivate SmartContract
```

#### Save socials

Supported socials:

- Telegram
- Discord
- Whats App
- Instagram

##### V1

Used socials stored in the browser cache, so customer should input his social on each new device

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    actor Customer
    participant TicketsApp
    actor BrowserLocalStorage

    Customer->>TicketsApp: Provide one of the socials
    TicketsApp->>BrowserLocalStorage: Save socials for the future use
```

##### V2

Used socials stored in the centralized database which allows to sync state of the all devices

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    actor Customer
    participant TicketsApp
    participant Backend
    participant Database
    actor BrowserLocalStorage

    Customer->>TicketsApp: Provide one of the socials
    TicketsApp->>BrowserLocalStorage: Save socials for the future use
    TicketsApp->>Backend: Send used socials
    Backend->>Database: Persist used socials
```

#### COMMENT Submit event request

### Tech stack

Solidity, OpenZeppelin, React, TypeScript, Tailwind, ethers.js, IPFS

Also a thin backend over database is required to provide free of charge ability to change event request data before it's approve, so it'll be implemented with Python, PostgreSQL and Django.

### Excluded features from the first stage

Given list of features can be interpreted as obviously required or any section below can unintentionally imply them, so they explicitly mentioned

- Tickets refund
- Cancel or refund event request submission
- Any sort of push notifications about any updates or new data
- Ticket price change on sold out and increasing available seats
- Remove assigned staff person to the event

### Proxy contract vs multiple versions

Because of big amount of reads from the blockchain (which lead to spending gas on call delegation in proxy) we offer to use multiple versions and support them on the client side. To prevent difficulties of funds & data migration between versions, we'll create new events in a new version, but still support the previous ones until all events there will be closed or canceled.

##### Event ticket

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class CyberValleyEventTicket {
        -string name
        -string symbol
        -address eventManagerAddress
        -mapping(uint256 => Multihash) ticketsMeta
        -mapping(uint256 => bool) isRedeemed
        -bytes32 MASTER_ROLE
        -bytes32 STAFF_ROLE
        -bytes32 EVENT_MANAGER_ROLE

        +setEventManagerAddress(address)
        +mint(address to: address, eventId: uint256, digest: bytes32, hashFunction: uint8, size: uint8)
        +ticketMeta(uint256)
        +redeemTicket(uint256)
    }

    class Multihash {
        -bytes32 digest
        -uint8 hashFunction
        -uint8 size
    }

    class IERC721 {
        <<interface>>
        +balanceOf(address): int
        +ownerOf(int): address
    }

    class IERC721Metadata {
        <<interface>>
        +name(): string
        +symbol(): string
        +tokenURI(int): string
    }

    class AccessControl {
        <<abstract>>
        +grantRole(bytes32, address)
        +revokeRole(bytes32, address)
        +hasRole(bytes32, address): bool
    }

    CyberValleyEventTicket --> Multihash
    CyberValleyEventTicket --> IERC721
    CyberValleyEventTicket --> IERC721Metadata
    CyberValleyEventTicket --> AccessControl
```
#### Backend

It's required for the two general purposes:

- Temporal storage for the event requests
- Indexing of smart contract state

Both of this solutions provide the most minimal off-chain reading pricing (probably even fit into free tier) and allow to publicly expose them without difficult caching system. Also all data will be stored locally, so it could be processed or aggregated in many wanted ways.

##### Indexer

Listens to logs of `EventManager` and `EventTicket` via WebSocket and store all events in the database. Catches up on possible downtime via using `getLogs`, starting from last event block number.

##### Sign-in with Ethereum

Because of requirement to allow posting and fetching event requests for the master some authentication process should be made. It could be made with JWT and [Infura's `personal_sign` method](https://docs.metamask.io/wallet/how-to/sign-data/#use-personal_sign)

##### API

###### GET /events

**Authority** `PUBLIC`

#### Frontend

##### Page structure

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Main Page] --> B[Event List]
    A --> C[Account]
    A --> D[Notifications]
    A --> E[Create Event]
    A --> F[Manage]

    B --> G[Event Details]
    G --> H[Attend Event]
    G --> I[Edit Event]

```
##### Main Page

Only authorized users (via [sign-in with Ethereum](https://docs.login.xyz/)) can have access to this page.

It provides the following components:

- **Notifications** - Amount of unread notifications with link to the [Notifications page](#notifications)
- **Event list** - Top `N` upcoming events and link to the [Events list page](#events-list)
- **Navigation** - List of available base pages for the current user
  - _Create event_ - Redirects to [Create event page](#create-event)
  - _Manage_ - Shown to `MANAGE:ACCESS` authority and redirects to the system [Manage page](#manage)
  - _Home_ - Redirects to the [Main Page](#main-page)
  - _Account_ - Redirects to the [Account page](#account)

[UI](https://excalidraw.com/?element=IGeC3qEnw6SEahcF-W6_G#room=70c146a09811de73a1cc,hq_dTKi_kHDEdIe1RL4T7g)

##### Notifications

Page renders a list of models returned by [GET /notifications](#get-notifications) endpoint

Each notification can be opened to get description and mark it as `seen`

##### Events list

Page renders a list of models returned by [GET /events](#get-events) endpoint

Each event card contains the following fields:

- Cover image
- Title
- Place title
- Start date

On click event card redirects to the [Event page](#event)

[UI](https://excalidraw.com/?element=A0GKWX9waISgJWCArAagX#room=70c146a09811de73a1cc,hq_dTKi_kHDEdIe1RL4T7g)

##### Event

Works with the model from [GET /events](#get-events) endpoint

Accepts `eventId` from URL parameters.

**If creator** handled by the back-end, so simple conditional rendering is needed. Only check for `TICKET:REDEEM` is required

- Cover image
- Title
- Place title
- Start date
- Description
- Ticket price
- Ticket status
  - **buy** - Attend button. Navigates to [Attend event page](#attend-event)
  - **show** - Show ticket button
  - **redeemed** - Ticket redeemed
- **if staff**
  - Redeem ticket
- **if creator**
  - Edit
  - if `canBeCanceled`
    - cancel date
    - required N tickets
- **if master**
  - if `canBeCanceled`
    - cancel date
    - required N tickets
  - if `status` is `pending`:
    - Decline / approve buttons

> Currently event model is pretty small, so it could be extracted from `TanStack Query` cache via [ensureQueryData](https://tanstack.com/query/latest/docs/reference/QueryClient/#queryclientensurequerydata).

##### Attend event

Requests a user to input his socials from [Save socials](#save-socials) section and redirects to the [Payment page](#payment). Consists of select box and input text field without any validation.

After payment redirects to [Operation status page](#operation-status) and shows:

- **On success** ticket QR code
- **On failure** failure details

###### Questions

- [Do socials really should be saved in IPFS or can be stored on the back-end?](#do-socials-really-should-be-saved-in-ipfs-or-can-be-stored-on-the-back-end)

##### Create event

Requests a user to provide [Event data](#event-data) and `Confirm` button which redirects to [Payment page](#payment)

- **imageUrl** - Image file or pasting should be accepted in the form, then it should be sent with [PUT /ipfs](#put-ipfs) to get a CID for the further processing

Other invariants should be checked in accordance to [Event data](#event-data) specification

##### Edit event

Works the same as [Create event page](#create-event), but instead of payment invokes `updateEvent` method of `EventManager` contract

[UI](https://excalidraw.com/?element=ECGnLzjTF3oespczMEN3K#room=70c146a09811de73a1cc,hq_dTKi_kHDEdIe1RL4T7g)

##### Account

Provides personal info to the user:

- **Events** - any relative i.e. attented or created. Master should see only `pending`
- **Logout** - allows to logout from the app

##### Manage

Provides administration features for the existing entities:

- **Event place** - only places without approved events can be edited
- **Staff** - add or remove staff by EOA address

##### Payment

Generic page for the payment

##### Operation status

Shows result of the made transaction

## Questions

### Both desktop and mobile are required?

> Mobile only

### Is it required to verify tickets without internet connection?

> No

### Will be there multiple masters or the only one in foreseeable future?

> Only one

### Event request price fixed in ETH, depends on ETH/USD rate or could be changed by the master?

> Smart contract should work with USDT

### Is a ticket transfer allowed e.g. customer A bought a ticket, but sent it to the customer B?

> Yes

It requires additional UI and flows to properly update ticket's meta data, so this feature will be skipped in the V1

### Will tickets have some metainfo about the owner (name, number etc)

> Yes, socials i.e. one or many {Telegram, Discord, Instagram, Whats App}

### Is it applicable to show available seats count for all (so the creator and master can see it as well without additional screen)?

> Yes

### UI design references

> https://dribbble.com/shots/23082238-Earthquake-Warning-App-Cyberpunk-Design-Style

### Do socials really should be saved in IPFS or can be stored on the back-end?

TBD

** Tech stack

Solidity, OpenZeppelin, React, TypeScript, Tailwind, ethers.js, IPFS

Also a thin backend over database is required to provide free of charge ability to change event request data before it's approve, so it'll be implemented with Python, PostgreSQL and Django.

** Excluded features from the first stage

Given list of features can be interpreted as obviously required or any section below can unintentionally imply them, so they explicitly mentioned

- Tickets refund
- Cancel or refund event request submission
- Any sort of push notifications about any updates or new data
- Ticket price change on sold out and increasing available seats
- Remove assigned staff person to the event

** Proxy contract vs multiple versions

Because of big amount of reads from the blockchain (which lead to spending gas on call delegation in proxy) we offer to use multiple versions and support them on the client side. To prevent difficulties of funds & data migration between versions, we'll create new events in a new version, but still support the previous ones until all events there will be closed or canceled.

*** Backend

It's required for the two general purposes:

- Temporal storage for the event requests
- Indexing of smart contract state

Both of this solutions provide the most minimal off-chain reading pricing (probably even fit into free tier) and allow to publicly expose them without difficult caching system. Also all data will be stored locally, so it could be processed or aggregated in many wanted ways.

**** Indexer

Listens to logs of ~EventManager~ and ~EventTicket~ via WebSocket and store all events in the database. Catches up on possible downtime via using `getLogs`, starting from last event block number.

**** Sign-in with Ethereum

Because of requirement to allow posting and fetching event requests for the master some authentication process should be made. It could be made with JWT and [[https://docs.metamask.io/wallet/how-to/sign-data/#use-personal_sign][Infura's ~personal_sign~ method]]

**** Main Page

Only authorized users (via [[https://docs.login.xyz/][sign-in with Ethereum]]) can have access to this page.

It provides the following components:

- *Notifications* - Amount of unread notifications with link to the [[*Notifications][Notifications page]]
- *Event list* - Top ~N~ upcoming events and link to the [[*Events list][Events list page]]
- *Navigation* - List of available base pages for the current user
  - _Create event_ - Redirects to [[*Create event][Create event page]]
  - _Manage_ - Shown to ~MANAGE:ACCESS~ authority and redirects to the system [[*Manage][Manage page]]

**** Notifications

Page renders a list of models returned by [[*GET /notifications][GET /notifications]] endpoint

Each notification can be opened to get description and mark it as ~seen~

**** Events list

Page renders a list of models returned by [[*GET /events][GET /events]] endpoint

Each event card contains the following fields:

- Cover image
- Title
- Place title
- Start date

On click event card redirects to the [[*Event][Event page]]

[[https://excalidraw.com/?element=A0GKWX9waISgJWCArAagX#room=70c146a09811de73a1cc,hq_dTKi_kHDEdIe1RL4T7g][UI]]

**** Event

Works with the model from [[*GET /events][GET /events]] endpoint

Accepts ~eventId~ from URL parameters.

*If creator* handled by the back-end, so simple conditional rendering is needed. Only check for ~TICKET:REDEEM~ is required

- Cover image
- Title
- Place title
- Start date
- Description
- Ticket price
- Ticket status
  - *buy* - Attend button. Navigates to [[*Attend event][Attend event page]]

**** Create event

- *imageUrl* - Image file or pasting should be accepted in the form, then it should be sent with [[*PUT /ipfs][PUT /ipfs]] to get a CID for the further processing

Other invariants should be checked in accordance to [[*Event data][Event data]] specification

* Questions

### Both desktop and mobile are required?

> Mobile only

### Is it required to verify tickets without internet connection?

> No

### Will be there multiple masters or the only one in foreseeable future?

> Only one

### Event request price fixed in ETH, depends on ETH/USD rate or could be changed by the master?

> Smart contract should work with USDT

### Is a ticket transfer allowed e.g. customer A bought a ticket, but sent it to the customer B?

> Yes

It requires additional UI and flows to properly update ticket's meta data, so this feature will be skipped in the V1

### Will tickets have some metainfo about the owner (name, number etc)

> Yes, socials i.e. one or many {Telegram, Discord, Instagram, Whats App}

### Is it applicable to show available seats count for all (so the creator and master can see it as well without additional screen)?

> Yes

### UI design references

** Do socials really should be saved in IPFS or can be stored on the back-end?

TBD
