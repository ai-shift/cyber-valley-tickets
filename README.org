* Problem

Cyber Valley wants to host events and needs a convenient way to accept events offers from creators, sell tickets in crypto, verify bought tickets from customer's devices and distribution of acquired means across creator, master and dev team

* Solution

Create Web3 mobile first web app based on Ethereum network which covers main needs

** Domain
*** Roles

**** Customer

Public role which has the following authorities:

- List events
- Buy ticket to event

**** Staff

Assigned by the master role. Has all customer's authorities and:

- Verify tickets for any event

**** Creator

A.k.a shaman has all customer's authorities and:

- Send event request
- Edit own event requests
- See pending own event requests

**** Master

Has all customer's, staff's and creator's authorities and:

- Create event place
- Approve event requests
- Edit event requests
- Cancel event
- Close events

*** Event data

Abstraction over some entertainment in the specific place during some amount of days.

#+begin_src plantuml :file ./img/event-model.png

** Tech stack

Solidity, OpenZeppelin, React, TypeScript, Tailwind, ethers.js, IPFS

Also a thin backend over database is required to provide free of charge ability to change event request data before it's approve, so it'll be implemented with Python, PostgreSQL and Django.

** Excluded features from the first stage

Given list of features can be interpreted as obviously required or any section below can unintentionally imply them, so they explicitly mentioned

- Tickets refund
- Cancel or refund event request submission
- Any sort of push notifications about any updates or new data
- Ticket price change on sold out and increasing available seats
- Remove assigned staff person to the event

** Proxy contract vs multiple versions

Because of big amount of reads from the blockchain (which lead to spending gas on call delegation in proxy) we offer to use multiple versions and support them on the client side. To prevent difficulties of funds & data migration between versions, we'll create new events in a new version, but still support the previous ones until all events there will be closed or canceled.

*** Backend

It's required for the two general purposes:

- Temporal storage for the event requests
- Indexing of smart contract state

Both of this solutions provide the most minimal off-chain reading pricing (probably even fit into free tier) and allow to publicly expose them without difficult caching system. Also all data will be stored locally, so it could be processed or aggregated in many wanted ways.

**** Indexer

Listens to logs of ~EventManager~ and ~EventTicket~ via WebSocket and store all events in the database. Catches up on possible downtime via using `getLogs`, starting from last event block number.

**** Sign-in with Ethereum

Because of requirement to allow posting and fetching event requests for the master some authentication process should be made. It could be made with JWT and [[https://docs.metamask.io/wallet/how-to/sign-data/#use-personal_sign][Infura's ~personal_sign~ method]]

**** API

***** GET /events

*Authority* ~PUBLIC~

*Returns* All available events in the system.

For ~EVENT:READ_SENSITIVE~ or event's creator receive ~EventSensitiveModel~.

***** PUT /ipfs

Accepts provided data (file or text), stores it in IPFS and returns [[https://docs.ipfs.tech/how-to/address-ipfs-on-web/#path-gateway][CID]]

***** POST /auth/generate-nonce/{public-address}

Generates session and checks if the given ~public-address~ is allowed to sign-in

*Returns* nonce or =403=

Verifies signature and returns JWT

*Returns* JWT token or =403=

**** Main Page

Only authorized users (via [[https://docs.login.xyz/][sign-in with Ethereum]]) can have access to this page.

It provides the following components:

- *Notifications* - Amount of unread notifications with link to the [[*Notifications][Notifications page]]
- *Event list* - Top ~N~ upcoming events and link to the [[*Events list][Events list page]]
- *Navigation* - List of available base pages for the current user
  - _Create event_ - Redirects to [[*Create event][Create event page]]
  - _Manage_ - Shown to ~MANAGE:ACCESS~ authority and redirects to the system [[*Manage][Manage page]]
  - _Home_ - Redirects to the [[*Main Page][Main page]]
  - _Account_ - Redirects to the [[*Account][Account page]]

**** Notifications

Page renders a list of models returned by [[*GET /notifications][GET /notifications]] endpoint

Each notification can be opened to get description and mark it as ~seen~

**** Events list

Page renders a list of models returned by [[*GET /events][GET /events]] endpoint

Each event card contains the following fields:

- Cover image
- Title
- Place title
- Start date

On click event card redirects to the [[*Event][Event page]]

[[https://excalidraw.com/?element=A0GKWX9waISgJWCArAagX#room=70c146a09811de73a1cc,hq_dTKi_kHDEdIe1RL4T7g][UI]]

**** Event

Works with the model from [[*GET /events][GET /events]] endpoint

Accepts ~eventId~ from URL parameters.

*If creator* handled by the back-end, so simple conditional rendering is needed. Only check for ~TICKET:REDEEM~ is required

- Cover image
- Title
- Place title
- Start date
- Description
- Ticket price
- Ticket status
  - *buy* - Attend button. Navigates to [[*Attend event][Attend event page]]
  - *show* - Show ticket button
  - *redeemed* - Ticket redeemed
- *if creator*
  - Edit
  - if ~canBeCanceled~
    - cancel date
    - required N tickets
- *if ~TICKET:REDEEM~*

After payment redirects to [[*Operation status][Operation status page]] and shows:

- *On success* ticket QR code
- *On failure* failure details

* Questions

** Both desktop and mobile are required?

#+begin_quote
Mobile only
#+end_quote

** Is it required to verify tickets without internet connection?

#+begin_quote
No
#+end_quote

** Will be there multiple masters or the only one in foreseeable future?

#+begin_quote
Only one
#+end_quote

** Event request price fixed in ETH, depends on ETH/USD rate or could be changed by the master?

#+begin_quote
Smart contract should work with USDT
#+end_quote

** Is a ticket transfer allowed e.g. customer A bought a ticket, but sent it to the customer B?

#+begin_quote
Yes
#+end_quote

It requires additional UI and flows to properly update ticket's meta data, so this feature will be skipped in the V1

** Will tickets have some metainfo about the owner (name, number etc)

#+begin_quote
Yes, socials i.e. one or many {Telegram, Discord, Instagram, Whats App}
#+end_quote

** Is it applicable to show available seats count for all (so the creator and master can see it as well without additional screen)?

#+begin_quote
Yes
#+end_quote

** UI design references
