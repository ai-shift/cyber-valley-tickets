# What Has Been Delivered

## 1. Local Provider Role
- Old **Master** is now called **LocalProvider**
- One Master wallet can add/remove many LocalProviders
- Each LocalProvider sets their own share per event

## 2. Verified Shaman Role
- New role for event organisers
- Apply inside the app, upload ID/docs
- LocalProviders get a Telegram message and press **Approve** or **Decline**
- Once approved, Shamans can request new event locations

## 3. Interactive Map
- Map on the home page with three switchable layers:
  – Upcoming events
  – Points of interest
  – Zone boundaries
- Click any marker for quick info
- Map is also embedded in the "Request new event space" form and allows to set a marker

## 4. Per-Event Shares
- Master can change their global share at any time
- When the event ends or is cancelled, money is split automatically between **Master** and **LocalProvider** that approved/created place, where the event happened

## 5. Event location Request Flow
- "Apply for new event space" button is always visible (not for **LocalProvider** and **Master**)
- Pick the exact spot on the map while filling the form
- LocalProviders should approve them from management page

## 6. Telegram Integration
- Social links moved to the Account page
- Telegram username is auto-saved if the user starts the bot from a special link in the app
- Events always use the latest Telegram handle; no need to re-type
